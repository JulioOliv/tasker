Tasker
======

Tasker is a Backbone.js sample application, developed by [Tiago Romero Garcia](http://www.tgarcia.com.br) to illustrate some articles he wrote for [Java Magazine](www.devmedia.com.br/java) in Brazil.

This application will simulate an Agile card system, using Java and Play! Framework as back-end.

The main purpose of Tasker is to show how to build smart client-side applications, exemplifying the most important Backbone.js concepts and showing how to add Jasmine tests with Sinon.JS mocks, code coverage, i18n, responsiveness and validation.
