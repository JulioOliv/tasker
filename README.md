Tasker
======

Tasker is a Backbone.js sample application, developed by [Tiago Romero Garcia](http://www.tgarcia.com.br) to illustrate some articles he wrote for [Java Magazine](www.devmedia.com.br/java) in Brazil.

This application will simulate an Agile card system, using Java and Play! Framework as back-end.

The main purpose of Tasker is to show how to build smart client-side applications, exemplifying the most important Backbone.js concepts and showing how to add Jasmine tests with Sinon.JS mocks, code coverage, i18n, responsiveness and validation. 

Next steps:
* add grunt or other approach to concatenate files
* change JUnit to TestNG
* enable production to only get minified files
* add Jasmine tests with Sinon.JS mocks
* increase TestNG tests covering task retrieval / update / delete scenarios
* add code coverage
* add i18n
* add validation
* deploy to production on heroku
* fix code formatting
* add more comments
* write documentation here

How to execute:
        play
        compile
        test
        run
