Tasker
======

Tasker is a Backbone.js sample application, developed by Tiago Romero Garcia to illustrate some articles he wrote for Java Magazine in Brazil.

This application will simulate an Agile card system, using Java and Play! Framework as back-end.

The main purpose of Tasker is to show how to build smart client-side applications, exemplifying the most important Backbone.js concepts and showing how to add Jasmine tests with Sinon.JS mocks, code coverage, i18n, responsiveness and validation.
